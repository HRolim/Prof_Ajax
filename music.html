            <p>1° Eye of Tiger - Survivor</p>
            <audio src="audio/Survivor - Eye Of The Tiger(MP3_128K).mp3" controls="controls"> </audio>
            <p>Letra: Rising up, back on the street
               Did my time, took my chances <br>
               Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet <br>
               Just a man and his will to survive <br>
               So many times it happens too fast <br>
               You change your passion for glory <br>
               Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past <br>
               You must fight just to keep them alive <br>
               It's the eye of the tiger <br>
               It's the thrill of the fight <br>
               Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
               And the last known survivor <br>
               Stalks his prey in the night <br>
               And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
               Face to face, out in the heat <br>
               Hanging tough, staying hungry <br>
               They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <br>
               For the kill with the skill to survive <br>
               It's the eye of the tiger <br>
               It's the thrill of the fight <br>
               Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
               And the last known survivor <br>
               Stalks his prey in the night <br>
               And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
               Rising up straight to the top <br>
               Had the guts, got the glory <br>
               Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop <br>
               Just a man and his will to survive <br>
               It's the eye of the tiger <br>
               It's the thrill of the fight <br>
               Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
               And the last known survivor <br>
               Stalks his prey in the night <br>
               And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
               The eye of the tiger <br>
               The eye of the tiger <br>
               The eye of the tiger <br>
               The eye of the tiger</p> <br>

            <p>2° Lose Yourself - Eminem</p>
            <audio src="audio/Eminem-Lose yourself (SOUTHPAW) 2017(MP3_160K).mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
            <p> Letra: 
                Look If you had <br>
                One shot <br>
                Or one opportunity <br>
                To seize everything you ever wanted <br>
                In one moment <br>
                Would you capture it <br>
                Or just let it slip? <br>
                Yo <br>
                His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
                There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti <br>
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready <br>
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' <br>
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud <br>
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out <br>
                He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now <br>
                The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow <br>
                Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity <br>
                Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked <br>
                He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No <br>
                He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes <br>
                It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke <br>
                He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's <br>
                Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody <br>
                Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better <br>
                His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping <br>
                This world is mine for the taking <br>
                Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order <br>
                A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem <br>
                It only grows harder, only grows hotter <br>
                He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him <br>
                Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter <br>
                Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father <br>
                He goes home and barely knows his own daughter <br>
                But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water <br>
                These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product <br>
                They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada <br>
                So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on <br>
                Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better <br>
                No more games, I'ma change what you call rage <br>
                Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged <br>
                I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed <br>
                I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage <br>
                But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher <br>
                Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper <br>
                All the pain inside amplified by the <br>
                Fact that I can't get by with my nine to <br>
                Five and I can't provide the right type of <br>
                Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers <br>
                And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer <br>
                This is my life and these times are so hard <br>
                And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus <br>
                Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna <br>
                Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much <br>
                For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's <br>
                Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got <br>
                To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot <br>
                Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not <br>
                Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot <br>
                So here I go, is my shot <br>
                Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment <br>
                You own it, you better never let it go <br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime <br>
                You better <br>
                You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p> <br>

            <p>3° I'm Still Standing - Elton John </p>
            <audio src="audio/Elton John - I_m Still Standing  (Official Video R(MP3_160K).mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
            <p>Letra: 
            You could never know what it's like <br>
            Your blood like winter freezes just like ice <br>
            And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you <br>
            You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use <br>
            And did you think this fool could never win? <br>
            Well look at me, I'm coming back again <br>
            I got a taste of love in a simple way <br>
            And if you need to know while I'm still standing, you just fade away <br>
            Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did <br>
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid <br>
            I'm still standing after all this time <br>
            Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            Once I never could have hoped to win <br>
            You're starting down the road leaving me again <br>
            The threats you made were meant to cut me down <br>
            And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now <br>
            You know I'm still standing better than I ever did <br>
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid <br>
            I'm still standing after all this time <br>
            Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did <br>
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid <br>
            I'm still standing after all this time <br>
            Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
